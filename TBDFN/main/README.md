This is the implementation code of our paper: "Triple-Branch Difference Fusion Network for Land Cover Change Detection with Heterogeneous Remote Sensing Images"


## Requirements：
>python=3.8
pytorch=1.9  
opencv-python=4.6.0.66  
scikit-image=0.18.1  
scikit-learn=0.24.1

## Usage

###1.Modal Transformation：
The g-train.py was used for training, resulting in the model

The modal transformation results were obtained by conducting the test using g-test.py.

###2.Change Detection
The model is trained using train.py

The detection results are obtained using test.py.
